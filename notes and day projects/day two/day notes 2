#Data Types

#String

print("Hello"[0]) #prints H
print("Hello"[-1]) # prints o

#Integer
print("123" + "345") # prints 123345
# numbers within double inverted commas are seen as strings
print(123 + 345) # numbers seen as integer
# to write large numbers legibly, use underscore
# eg 123_456_789
print(123_456_789)

# Float

3.14159 # Floating point number ie decimal

# Boolean

True # both values always capital
False 


# Type conversion
num_char = len(input("What is your name?\n")) #len will automatically save as integer

new_num_char = str(num_char) # Convert from int to str
# in string concatenation, only strings can be used
print("Number of letters in your name is " + new_num_char)

a = float(123)
print(a)
print(type(a)) # typecheck

# rounding numbers
print(8/3)
print(round(8/3)) # round the number. converting to int just chops off everything after the decimal point
print(round(8/3,2)) # round to two decimal points 
print(round(8/3,1)) # round to one decimal point

# f-string IMPORTANT
score = 0
score += 1
height = 1.8
isWinning = True
print(f"Your score is {score}, your height is {height} and you are winning is {isWinning}") #Helps convert different datatypes, super convenient. I could add a int to a str
